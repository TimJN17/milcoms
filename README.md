# Military Commenting (MilComs) 

## Features
VS Code Extension for comments. 

This project will provide a more enjoyable commenting style. This extension enables a commenting style that mirrors some aspects of miltiary weapons system operating manuals. This extension will connect the following words [DANGER, CAUTION, ALERT, SUCCESS] with the following emojies: [ ‚ùó, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üö®, ‚úÖ]. More will be added in the future.

‚ùó DANGER : Indicates an imminent hazard that could cause harm to your model (e.g.: regression vs. classificaion; continuous vs. discrete data).

‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION : Indicates a potential hazard that could cause harm to your model if approved procedures are not followed (e.g.: epxloding grdient).

üö® ALERT : Indicates a critical component of the software, e.g. recursion, datatypes, data stream rates, etc. 

‚úÖ SUCCESS : Indicates something good about the model or software!

```python
# ‚ùóDANGER : 
"""‚ùóDANGER : """

# ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION :
"""‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION :"""

# üö® ALERT :
"""üö® ALERT :"""

# ‚úÖ SUCCESS :
"""‚úÖ SUCCESS :"""
```
