# Military Commenting (MilComs) 

HOW TO: Start typing any of the below words & receive a recommended emjoji.

## Features
This is a limited VS Code Extension for comments & documentation & only works for Python. 

This project will provide a more enjoyable commenting style. This extension enables a commenting style that mirrors some aspects of miltiary weapons system operating manuals. 

This extension will connect the following words [DANGER, CAUTION, ALERT, SUCCESS] with the following emojies: [ ❗, ⚠️, 🚨, ✅]. More will be added in the future. More languages will be added in the future. 

❗ DANGER : Indicates an imminent hazard that could cause harm to your model (e.g.: regression vs. classificaion; continuous vs. discrete data).

⚠️ CAUTION : Indicates a potential hazard that could cause harm to your model if approved procedures are not followed (e.g.: epxloding grdient).

🚨 ALERT : Indicates a critical component of the software, e.g. recursion, datatypes, data stream rates, etc. 

✅ SUCCESS : Indicates something good about the model or software!

🏆 VICTORY : Indicates a complete sytsem functionality; better than SUCCESS!

💥 BOOM : Indicates seomthing cool!

```python
# ❗DANGER :

# ✅ SUCCESS :
